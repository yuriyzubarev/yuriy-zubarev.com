h2. Counting a number of added lines to a file

Problem: need a quick way to monitor number of queries executed by Hibernate as I browse a web application. All queries are logged into 'hibernate.log' file.

Solution:

{% highlight bash %}
echo "0" > counter; while true; do CURRENT=`wc -l hibernate.log | awk '{print $1}'`; echo $(($CURRENT - `cat counter`)); echo $CURRENT > counter; sleep 5; done
{% endhighlight %}
