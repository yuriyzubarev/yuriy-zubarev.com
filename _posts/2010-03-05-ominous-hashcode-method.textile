title: Ominous hashCode() method
---
I just spent couple of hours debugging a subtle problem only to pinpoint the root cause to an erroneous implementation of <strong>hashCode()</strong> method. It was a nice refresher in Java basics. Here is the culprit:

[sourcecode lang="java"]
  @Override
  public int hashCode() {
    return super.hashCode() + (this.code == null ? 0 : this.code.hashCode());
  }
[/sourcecode]

Any guesses?
