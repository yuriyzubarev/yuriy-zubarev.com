Problem: need a quick way to monitor number of queries executed by Hibernate as I browse a web application. All queries are logged into 'hibernate.log' file.

Solution:

<code>echo "0" > counter; while true; do CURRENT=`wc -l hibernate.log | awk '{print $1}'`; echo $(($CURRENT - `cat counter`)); echo $CURRENT > counter; sleep 5; done
</code>
