<h2>Third-Generation RFID Is on It's Way</h2>

<blockquote>Early tags were passive, using signals from RFID readers to power up. Newer technologies use active tags, which have their own battery power. The added power increases their communication range.

The third generation of RFID - called wireless-sensor-network (WSN) technology - works with active tags. They gather information and then send it from tag to tag over a mesh network until it reaches the location at which the data will be processed.</blockquote>
