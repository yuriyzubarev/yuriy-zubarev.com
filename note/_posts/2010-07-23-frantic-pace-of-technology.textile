title: Frantic pace of technology
---
The latest issue of "Computer" has an informative article "Simplicity as a Driver for Agile Innovation" with the following gem:

<blockquote>... The frantic pace of technology provides its own chaos: before a certain technology reaches maturity and can repay the enormous investments for its development and production, a newer option attracts attention with novelty and fresh promises.</blockquote>

This quote succinctly describes the environment of IT and underlines my own 10+ years of experience. At every point and with almost every decision we have to balance out maturity of incumbent products and promises of new ones.
