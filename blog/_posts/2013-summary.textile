team space separated form other team spaces; create individuality; conformance is not inspiring

steve mccomel; best prorammers are 10 times more effective than average ones - true

waiting for superman; you have access - you're impowered

public speaches: son't dwell on past; stop making execuses; stop feeling guilty; look at the future

same questions are asked every time; no concise and trusted diagrams

management is tougher than development
